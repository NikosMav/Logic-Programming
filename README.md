# Logic-Programming

This repository contains my Logic Programming homework assignments completed during my course at NKUA (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens). The assignments were done using the Prolog programming language.

## Contents

This repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a different Logic Programming homework assignment.

Logic Programming is a programming paradigm that uses formal logic for problem-solving. Prolog is a popular logic programming language known for its use in artificial intelligence and symbolic reasoning.
